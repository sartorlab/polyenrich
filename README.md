Repository for the Poly-Enrich paper

Non-large Data files are organized into folders of each figure. Instructions to download larger data files are in the Rmd file, if needed.

Cloning the entire repository should allow you to run each code block (that do not require extra download steps) to reproduce the data analysis. Figures should be immediately reproducable barring package installation and loading.
